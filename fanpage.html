        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>Leonard Berstein was one of the most prolific American composers of the 20th century, not to mention an avid music lecturer, conductor and pianist. When European composers were the most famous at the time, and American composers were frowned upon, Lenny was among the first US conductors and composers to receive worldwide fame, along with his teacher Aaron Copeland. Leonard is best known for his Broadway musical "West Side Story", his ballet "Fancy Free", and his opera "Candide". Donal Henahan, a famous music critic said he was "one of the most prodigiously talented and successful musicians in American history.""
